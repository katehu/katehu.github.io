 **Kate Hu** is a National Research Service Award postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, developing causal inference methods that leverage auxiliary information embedded in time series and spatial data to adjust for unmeasured and mismeasured confounding, and applying them to impact studies of climate change.
 
Before returning to academia, Dr. Kate Hu was the Head of Data Science at [Aclima](https://air.health/)  Inc, where she drives the company’s data science research and development to deliver hyper-local air pollution maps at unprecedented block-by-block resolution by dispatching a fleet of vehicles equipped with environmental sensors. This environmental “big data” fills a big gap in what policymakers and activists rely on to bring environmental justice to [underserved communities](https://woeip.org/). In particular, she led the research on scalable sampling schemes and inference methods underlying these maps. Before joining Aclima Inc, Dr. Kate Hu was a senior quantitative researcher at [Climate](https://climate.com/features/variable-rate-seeding/) LLC, innovating precision agriculture solutions to help farmers maximize the economica return and adapt to climate change.  She first led the research program in sampling and experimental designs to collect field data scientifically for model calibration and evaluation. Then she led the interdisciplinary research efforts to develop precision nitrogen treatment algorithms that respond to local environmental and climate change by combining physcial processes models, statistical models, and new sensing technologies. 

Dr. Kate Hu graduated with First Class Honours from the University of Hong Kong, received an M.S. from Harvard University, and obtained a Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Washington, Seattle. Her PhD dissertation is A Z-estimation System for Semiparametric Models with Two-phase Sampling Designs under the guidance of [Norman Breslow](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/obituaries/dr-norman-breslow-74-dies-uw-biostatistician-led-to-advances-in-medical-research/), Gary Chan, and Jon Wellner.
