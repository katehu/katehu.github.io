# Research Interest

My research interests are driven by three goals: 1) enable people to generate and use large complex data more intelligently and efficiently, 2) use statistics and measurements to advance scientific discovery, and 3) use data science to improve human and the earth’s health.
1. [Analysis methods for complex data generated from smart study designs](#method)
2. [Smart study designs to reduce costs and bias](#study-design)
3. [Theoretical tools for complex data analysis methods development](#theory)

4. [Additive hazards models](#model)
5. [Applications in precision agriculture, public health, and climate hazards](#application)

Long term
7. [Methods to integrate statistical models, measurements, and scientific knowledge](#measurement-model)
8. [Epistemology](#epistemology)


<small> Publications are grouped by topics. Papers written for dual purposes appear under two categories.<small>
