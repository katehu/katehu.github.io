# Research Interest

My currect research focus includes <!-- are driven by three goals: 1) enable people to generate and use large complex data more intelligently and efficiently, 2) use data science to improve planetary health --- human health and the state of the natural systems on which it depends, and 3) advance precision agriculture. In particular, my research interests include the following -->

1. [Analysis methods for efficient study designs](#method)
2. [Leverage auxiliary information in large complex data to reduce bias and enhance inference precision](#auxiliary)
3. [Theoretical tools for complex data methods development](#theory)
4. [Applications in  public health, planetary science, and precision agriculture](#application)

My long term research interests are listed below. Discussions, suggestions, and collaborations are welcome! 
5. [Sampling designs with and for new technologies](#study-design)
6. [Additive hazards models](#ah)
7. [Methods to integrate statistical models, measurements, and scientific knowledge for precision farm management](#measurement-model)
8. [Make model developement transparent and accessible](#model)
9. [Epistemology](#epistemology)
