# Research Interest

My currect research focus includes <br/>
<!-- are driven by three goals: 1) enable people to generate and use large complex data more intelligently and efficiently,-->
<!--2) use data science to improve planetary health --- human health and the state of the natural systems on which it depends, -->
<!--3) and 3) advance precision agriculture. In particular, my research interests include the following -->

1. [Leverage auxiliary information in large complex data to reduce bias and enhance inference precision](#auxiliary)
2. [Analysis methods for efficient study designs](#method)
3. [Theoretical tools for complex data methods development](#theory)
4. [Applications in  public health, planetary health, and precision agriculture](#application)
