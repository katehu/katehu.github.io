1. [Use auxiliary information to adjust for unmeasured confounding bias](#bias)
2. [Use auxiliary information to enhance inference precision](#precision)
3. [Use auxiliary information to improve study designs](#study-design)



 
**Current work**: I am developing several methods to leverage auxiliary information to adjust for unmeasured confounding, using techniques in Bayesian statistics, econometrics, and proximal causal inference. I focus on recovering the causal estimand for continuous exposure, which is often the case for environmental exposure. <br/>
