A Z-estimation System

I am interested in making model development more systematic, transparent, and accessible. I have three sub-research areas. 

1. A system to rapidly extend semiparametric models to new sampling designs, models, and incorporation of ancillary data.

2. A software for everyone to build their own models. Unlike  machine learning, I aim to let this system help people instead of machines to learn. To learn what? --- express structures behind data, the limitations and sometimes danger from imperfect data.

3. Bridge statistical and mechanistic models, which can reveal and sometimes handle data issues that mechanistic modelers may ignore.
