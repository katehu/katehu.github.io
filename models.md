A Z-estimation System

I am interested in making model development more systematic, transparent, and accessible. I have three sub-research areas. 



1. [A system to rapidly extend semiparametric models](#Z-system)
2. [EEsy: A software for everyone to build their own models](#EEsy)
3. [Bridge statistical and mechanistic models](#combine)<br/>
