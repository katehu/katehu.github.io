A Z-estimation system

I am interested in making model development more systematic, transparent, and accessible. My research is divided into three sub-research area. 

1) develop a systematic theoretical tool set for semiparametric and nonparametric model development to expediate the extension of existing models to new ancillary data, models, and study designs.

2) create a system and a platform for everyone to build their own models. Unlike  machine learning, I aim to let this system help people instead of machine to learn. To learn what? --- the causal structures behind phenomena and the limitation and sometimes danger from imperfect data.

3) bridge statistical and mechanistic models, which can reveal and sometimes handle data issues that mechanistic modelers may ignore. 


Theoretical tools for semiparametric model development systematic and transparent:
