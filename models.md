## A Z-estimation system

I am passionate about "systematic" model development.

I divide my research area into two sub-research years. 

1) develop a systematic theoretical tool for semiparametric and nonparametric model development so that existing models could be easily extended to support statistical inference with new types of models and sampling designs.

2) create a system for a) everyone to build their own models with data and try their imagined model structures; b) for scientists to bridge statistical models and mechanical models, which can reveal and sometimes handle data issues that applied mathematicians sometimes ignore. 

Unlike some machine learning approaches, I aim to let this system help people instead of machine to learn. To learn the causal structures behind phenomena and the extent of danger from various data issues.
