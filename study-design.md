# Research Interest

My currect research focus includes <br/>
Most statistical tools improve efficiency after obtaining data through sophisticated techniques, 
but if costs can be substantially reduced at the data-collection step, then scientists and industry leaders may afford and even welcome a 
straightforward and scalable statistical tool with a minor loss of efficiency in analyzing the data. Motivated by this belief, after my PhD, 
I moved to the industry to research data-collection methods, and worked with field scientists, sensor engineers, and software engineers side by side to implement these methods
in the real world. In the meantime, I continue developing statistical analysis tools, guidance materials, and software to ease the use of complex but efficient study designs, and 
continue developing theoretical tools to faciliate the extension of methods for simple random samples to complex study designs.
