I finished translating the book _objectivity_ with my friend  Meng, which leads me to another interesting book _Trust in Numbers_ by Theodore Porter.
Both could be considered as a history of science book. I got interested in this work because I think the pursuit of objectivity motivates the field of statistics, which often deal with developing scientific methods to collect, analyze, represent, interprete data to remove human bias. 

If you believe my statement in the above that the pursuit of objectivity motivates the field of statistics, then let's continue to consider the next level question: In turn what motivates objectivity? That was a question these two books attempt to address and interestingly they hold opposite views. _objectivity_ believes the evolvement of scientific self motivates objectivity while _Trust in Numbers_  argues that the expanded trade and the change of how socienties operate demands objectivity.

If you asked me who I agreed more seven years ago, I would say of course the arguments in _objectivity_, but now after working industry for six years, for the same question I would change my answer to the opposite. I encountered more frictions when selling statistics to scientists than engineers, product developers, and business men and women. Statistical methods developed so far seem to help ther latter group for decision making but they often frustrate scientists to develope their sceintific stories, for example, the significance test. Scientists often make judgement based on a plethora of evidence in all types of format, mechanical reasoning, anecdote, theories, data, samll experiement, etc. Such judegment will gradually form a scientific theory. Such theorey is not expected to be permanent. The science community has a tolernce for the theorey being wrong and will change the theorety once the new evidence comes in. Their mode of progress does not match with the statistical method of using solely data, ideally a lot of data, to "reject" or "not reject" a hypothesis. On the other hand. Industry problems often are simpler than a scientific question, asking for a decision rather than a causal story. They are able to collect a massive dataset with the management tools to standardize the data collection. It seems to me the statistical tools generated so far match their pattens of operate and need more. 

This discovery is a bittersweet to me because I was drawn to statistics with a hope to advance science with it, but to know it is the begining of finding the right tools more suitable for sciences.
