I finished translating the book _Objectivity_ with my friend  Meng, which leads me to another interesting book _Trust in Numbers_ by Theodore Porter.
Both could be considered as a history of science book. I got interested in this work because I think the pursuit of objectivity motivates the field of statistics, which often deals with how to remove human bias through developing scientific methods to collect, analyze, represent, and interprete data. 

If you believe my statement in the above that the pursuit of objectivity motivates the field of statistics, then let's continue to consider the next level question: in turn what motivates objectivity? This is a question that ultimately tells us what drives the development of statistics. This is also a question these two books attempt to address and interestingly they hold opposite views. _Objectivity_ believes the evolvement of scientific self motivates objectivity while _Trust in Numbers_  argues that the expanded trade from local to larger geographic areas and the change of how socienties operate demand objectivity.

If you asked me who I agreed more seven years ago, I would say of course the arguments in _Objectivity_, but now after I have worked in industry for six years, for the same question I actually would change my answer to the opposite. The theory in _Objectivity_ does not match my experiences in industry.  I encountered more frictions when selling statistics to scientists than engineers, product developers, and business men and women. Statistical methods developed so far seem to help the latter groups for decision makings than the first group--- scientists. I also observe statistical methods often frustrate scientists to develope their sceintific stories, for example we hear the scientists complain often their hands are tied by the significance test developed by statisticians. If we look at which subfield of statistics has flourish in the past few decades, it is the medical statistics. Yes, medicine is a field of science but the stakeholders are doctors and pharmaceutical companies who mainly rely on statistical evidience for making decisions. Very few papers in medical statistics integrates scientific knowledge in medicine but evaluates the effectiveness of a drug without using any knowledge of biochemistry behind how a drug works. Statistics seem to serve  pharmaceutical industry more than the sciences of medicine, which is to answer the question of `why?`.


Scientists usually make a judgement based on a plethora of evidence in all types of format, mechanical reasoning, anecdote, theories, data, small experiement, etc. Such judegment will gradually form a scientific theory. Such theorey is not expected to be permanent. The science community has a tolernce for the theory being wrong and will change the theory once a new piece of evidence comes in. Their mode of progress does not match with the statistical method of using solely data, ideally a lot of data, to "reject" or "not reject" a hypothesis. Scientists can not afford to collect a large amount of data. If I were a scientist, I would be annoyed by statisticians who attacked my argument wielding a weapon of significance test. "Your data is not large enough to support your hypothesis!" a statistican says. "Yes, you are right. Your theory is right but it is not practical! I can not collect that much data and I have other forms of evidences to support my belief." I would argue when I wears the hat of being a scientist.    On the other hand, industry problems often are simpler than a scientific question, asking for a decision rather than a causal story. They are able to collect a massive dataset with the management tools to standardize the data collection. It seems to me the statistical tools generated so far fit their mode of operation well. 

This discovery is a bittersweet to me because I was drawn to statistics with a wish to advance sciences with it but now I found the way statisticians think or inherit to think do not match the needs of scientists, but to know this is the begining of finding the right tools more suitable for sciences.
