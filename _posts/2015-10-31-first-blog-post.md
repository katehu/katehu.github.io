Statistics is common sense and simple solutions often work. The big data phenomena will drive us farther and farther from being simple. Here is a poem that I believe tells what may happen in the next fifty years in statistics. Let's see. <br/>


All that is gold does not glitter,<br/>
Not all those who wander are lost;<br/>
The old that is strong does not wither,<br/>
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.<br/>
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,<br/>
A light from the shadows shall spring;<br/>
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br/>
The crownless again shall be king.‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
 --J. R. R. Tolkien<br/>
